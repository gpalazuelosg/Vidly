annotation from Mosh's ASP.NET MVC course


- enabled migrations from Package Manager Console, following command:
	enable-migrations


- then, run the initial migration with following command:
	add-migration InitialModel	


- in file "IdentityModels.cs", Class "ApplicationDbContext"
	add the following line after Class declaration:

	public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

	(for exercise i will Movies later)


- then, run again the following command (from Package Manager Console):

	add-migration InitialModel -force
	
	(with these, check the original files were overwritten including now the Customer table)
	
	
- then run creation of database with following command:
	update-database
	
	at this point, the web.config file has the following:
	
	  <connectionStrings>
		<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\aspnet-Vidly-20161015020857.mdf;Initial Catalog=aspnet-Vidly-20161015020857;Integrated Security=True"
		  providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	  </connectionStrings>


- as an exercise to show what to steps to follow when modifying database tables structure, let's make a change adding new fields into Customer model, then run a new migration with following command:
	
	add-migration AddIsSubscribedToCustomer
		then
	update-database
	
	this creates a new set of .CS files inside the Migrations folder only containing this new addition; which in this case just adding the IsSubscribedToNewsletter field to Customer model class
	AND
	the second command, updates the entire database --- check this is an small migration, no errors expected.
	

- then, for the next change, a second model class was added (MembershipType) with some fields. This is a Type value in our model. So, a new migration is needed with the following command:

	add-migration AddMembershipType
		then
	update-database
	
	with this commands, the migration files for MembershipType is added
		AND
	the database is updated again, more important: no errors as this was an small change to the model classes and tables
